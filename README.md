# ExtractRADOLANHourlyData
This script extracts [DWD RADOLAN hourly precipitation amounts](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/radolan/radolan_info/home_freie_radolan_kartendaten.html) at point locations. It uses the [2017.002 reproc data](http://dx.doi.org/10.5676/DWD/RADKLIM_RW_V2017.002) when available for the dates of interest, or else checks the [recent](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/hourly/radolan/recent/asc/) folder for data.

## How to use
 - Download all files from this repository (e.g. via Code -> Download ZIP above).
 - Extact the ZIP file. The directory where "ExtractRADOLANHourlyData.R" is stored is called "working directory" in the following.
 - Make sure all other .R files are stored in a subfolder "HelpingFunctions" of the working directory.
 - Make sure the file "TargetLocationsAndTimeSpans.csv" is stored in a subfolder "Input" of the working directory.
 - Install all libraries listed in the beginning of "ExtractRADOLANHourlyData.R".
 - Adjust the variable "WorkDir" in the beginning of "ExtractRADOLANHourlyData.R" to match the working directory.
 - Run the script. Output is incrementally written to a file in WorkDir/Output.
 - Adjust the "TargetLocationsAndTimeSpans.csv" to your needs.
 - **WARNING:** For some years or data sources (recent vs. reproc), RADOLAN raw data is not in the default format, so extracted values need to be multiplied by 10

## Validation
The values extracted with the R script have been compared to values extracted with the [radolan2map QGIS plugin](https://gitlab.com/Weatherman_/radolan2map/-/wikis/home). Precipitation amounts at four locations for 2021-01-01 00:50 (ASCII raster file RW-20210101.tar.gz from [here](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/grids_germany/hourly/radolan/)) have been compared. The results are shown below. The difference observed for location C is likely related to interpolation during extraction from raster data. The spatial projection information for the raster data used in the R script has been taken from page 17 in [this pdf](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/help/RADOLAN/Unterstuetzungsdokumente/Unterstuetzungsdokument_Verwendung_von_RADOLAN_RADKLIM_Produkten_in_GIS_Software.pdf).
